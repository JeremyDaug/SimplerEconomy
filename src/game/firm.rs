/// # Firm 
/// 
/// A firm is the smallest unit of business. It deals with Production and local economic
/// calculation
/// 
/// When connected together they form a Company, with the firms inside being called 
/// Sub-Firms.
/// 
/// ## Properties
/// 
/// Firms (including sub-firms) should have unique ids and names to help with both
/// navigation and player readability.
/// 
/// All firms have a market which they primarily act in and a location hex where
/// they physically operate. The latter is used for when tiles change regions.
/// 
/// The Organizational Data of a firm is the Parent (ID for it's owning firm if any),
/// children (the sub-firms it owns), level (the importance in a Company Structure),
/// and org_ai_weights for how the firm operates and manages both itself and it's 
/// children.
/// 
/// The Population Data is mostly connections and rules for who has a relationship
/// with the firm. Owner defines who owns it, how it's owned, and how profits and
/// losses are distributed, as well as a few other rules.
